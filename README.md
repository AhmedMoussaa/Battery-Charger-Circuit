Hello

in this repositry i will show a design for the battery charging circuit 
before showing the circuit , we had to calculate the loads 
where we have (150+150) mA for 2 motors + 50 mA for Arduino so 350 mA in total

so a battery that gives +350 mA will be a good choice like "DURACELL" battery where it gives 400 mAh
with an operating time of 1 Hour.
